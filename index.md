## 🔍 What is LOLWeb?

**LOLWeb** documents the offensive and post-exploitation use of **legitimate cloud and web services** to perform actions typically associated with malware or threat actors — but in a stealthy, often undetectable way.

This technique category is inspired by *Living off the Land* (LOTL) but focuses on **"Living off the Legitimate Web"** — leveraging trusted services to blend in, bypass security controls, and avoid detection.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📚 Maintain a **living knowledge base** of known abuse techniques per web service.
