# Google Translate

## Description

Google Translate is a widely used legitimate web service for translating text and web pages.  
Attackers can abuse Google Translate as a **proxy tunneling** mechanism by leveraging the URL parameter `u=` to access external web content indirectly, bypassing network restrictions and filtering.

---

## Technique

- Use the URL pattern:  
  `https://translate.google.com/translate?u=<target_url>`
- This makes Google Translate fetch the target URL and render its content inside Googleâ€™s domain.
- Traffic appears as requests to `translate.google.com`, which is often whitelisted in corporate environments.

---

## Examples of abuse

- Exfiltrating data through crafted URLs.
- Command and Control (C2) communication by tunneling requests through Google Translate.
- Bypassing firewalls or web filters by hiding malicious requests behind Google Translate traffic.

## Detection and Mitigation

### Indicators

- Monitor your infrastructure for high frequency of requests to `https://translate.google.com`
